# Exploring-NOAA-Precipitation-Types-and-Temperature-Profiles
Our dataset, NOAA Precipitation types, provides data that spans 18 years and 
focuses on the precipitation events of non-summer months. The data records
precipitation events at various weather stations and categorizes them into either
Rain, Snow, Ice Pellets, or Freezing rain. The observations that are recorded are
correlated with altitude temperature profiles from corresponding grid boxes in a
numerical weather prediction model. This model allows us to understand how 
temperature influences precipitation type. The project aims to identify outliers
and improve classification of precipitation types using temperature profiles. A
way we are finding outliers is by finding data points that we know should not 
exist but do exist. In this report, we are looking at visibly outlying temperature
profiles of ice pellets and looking at precipitation classified as snow that is
measured above the freezing point.â€‹
Weather patterns, especially precipitation events, play a crucial role in various
aspects of our daily lives, impacting agriculture, transportation, and public safety. Understanding and accurately predicting these patterns are essential for informed decision-making and risk mitigation. In this context, our project focuses on 
analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically targeting precipitation events during 
non-summer months over 18 years.

The NOAA Precipitation Types dataset records precipitation events at different
weather stations, categorizing them into Rain, Snow, Ice Pellets, or Freezing Rain.
Our objective is to delve into the relationship between temperature profiles and
precipitation types, seeking to identify outliers and enhance the classification
accuracy of these events. The significance of this study lies in its potential 
to improve the reliability of weather forecasting models and, consequently, the
efficiency and safety of various sectors.

The project primarily addresses two noteworthy anomalies within the dataset: 
discrepancies in temperature profiles of ice pellets and instances where snow is
recorded at temperatures well above freezing. These anomalies raise concerns 
about the accuracy of existing weather prediction models and their real-world
implications for sectors that rely heavily on precise weather forecasts.

To address the issue of ice pellet temperature discrepancies, we embarked on a 
systematic exploration of the dataset, creating visualizations and tables to
highlight outliers. Despite extensive efforts, our findings indicate that the 
outliers in ice pellet temperature profiles appear to lack any discernible 
correlation with specific recording stations or days, posing challenges in
predicting or addressing these anomalies effectively.

Similarly, we observed instances where snow was recorded at temperatures above 
the freezing point, prompting an investigation into the recording stations 
contributing to these inaccuracies. Our analysis revealed geographical 
clusters of problematic stations, suggesting potential regional influences
on data accuracy and emphasizing the need for localized investigations into
climatic variations and data collection protocols.

The project's findings not only raise questions about the accuracy of current 
weather models but also hold practical implications for public safety and various
industries. The identification of outliers prompts a critical examination of the data 
quality and collection protocols at recording stations, highlighting the necessity
for standardized practices in weather data recording.
